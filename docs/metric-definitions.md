# Metric definitions

Metric policy: `FIELD_SERVICE_METRICS_V2`  
Business score policy: `FIELD_SERVICE_SCORE_V2`

## Service

- `completion_rate`: assigned active work orders divided by all active work orders.
- `assigned_on_time_rate`: on-time assigned work orders divided by assigned work orders.
- `committed_on_time_rate`: on-time assigned work orders divided by all active work orders. Unassigned work remains in the denominator.
- `total_late_minutes` and `p90_late_minutes`: lateness across assigned active work.

## Capacity

- `service_utilization`: service minutes divided by normal shift minutes.
- `occupied_utilization`: travel, waiting, and service minutes divided by normal shift minutes.
- `travel_ratio` and `waiting_ratio`: each component divided by occupied minutes.
- `overtime_ratio`: overtime divided by normal shift minutes.
- `normalized_workload`: service minutes divided by normal shift minutes.
- `normalized_workload_range`: highest normalized workload minus lowest.

## Replanning stability

- `same_technician_rate`: pending work that keeps its technician.
- `adjacency_preservation_rate`: prior same-technician predecessor pairs that remain adjacent.
- `start_time_shift_median` / `start_time_shift_p90`: absolute start-time movement.
- `customer_notification_count`: removed work, technician changes, or start-time movement over 15 minutes.

## Two objective values

`solver_objective_value` is returned by OR-Tools and only has meaning for that solver configuration. `business_score` is recomputed from common business metrics and carries a policy version. Strategy experiments compare the latter and show the raw KPI beside it.
